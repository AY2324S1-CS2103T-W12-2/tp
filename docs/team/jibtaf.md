### Project: ManaGease

ManaGease - Contact management app to simplify and centralize information for full-time employees.
It offers easy access to essential details such as name, email, phone number, address, bank accounts, salary, joining date, and annual leaves. With all the information, the app can help to track employeesâ€™ annual leave and also generate their payroll automatically. This helps to reduce errors and enhance overall operational efficiency. This results in time and cost savings, improved organization, and a smoother workflow for your business.
