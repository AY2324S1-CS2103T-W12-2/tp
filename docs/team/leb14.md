### Project: ManaGease

ManaGease

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Read a specific field from a particular employee.
  * What it does: Allow the user to read a specific field from a particular employee.
  * Justification: The significance of this feature lies in its ability to enhance the application's efficiency. By enabling users to target and extract information from a specific field for a particular employee, it streamlines the process of navigating through the list of person cards in the application. This not only saves valuable time but also ensures more precise and focused access to the required data.
  * Highlights: The adjustment involves the necessity to incorporate checks for different prefixes to appropriately showcase specific fields. Additionally, modifications to the Person Cards have been implemented, refining their display to emphasize only the specified field.
